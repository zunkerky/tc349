	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>Q: What do I need to bring in for my computer repair?</h3>
		<h3>A: For desktop computer repair please bring in just the desktop tower. For laptop repair please bring in the laptop along with the power cord.</h3>
		<h3>Q: How long do repairs take?</h3>

		<h3>Q: What is the best Anti-Virus software?</h3>
		<h3>A: There is no perfect Anti-Virus software. We have found that some of the available free software will work just as well as the paid Anti-Virus software. We reccommend Avast Free Anti-Virus or if you would like to pay for Anti-Virus software we recommend GDATA or Kaspersky.</h3>
