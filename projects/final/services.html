			<h3>Data Backup</h3>
				<p>Having a data backup plan is crucial to all computer users, and is something that is far too often overlooked. Every hard drive in every computer will fail at some point. Having a backup of important files can protect someone from losing important documents, pictures, and other files when their computer's hard drive crashes.</p> 
				<p>Most users want to have a backup but are unsure of where to start. There are many services and programs to use to backup your data and it can be confusing to know the differences between the many backup types. At DeWitt Computer Center we will explain the different backup options available and help determine the proper backup for your specific needs.</p>
