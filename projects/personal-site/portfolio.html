				<p>My name is Kyle Zunker. I am currently a student at Michigan State University.
				</p>
				<p>I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Media and Information, with a specilization in Information Technology, at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences. I have long had a passion for computers and related electronic equipment. The capabilities of these devices have always fascinated me. I would like to pursue a career in the field of Information Technology. What started out as a curiosity and a hobby has now turned into a career choice. The combination of both being passionate about computer technology, and what seems like a stable industry, are what has drawn me to this industry.
				</p>

				<p>The specific areas of IT that most interest myself are the following:
				</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Computer Networking</li>
						<li>IT Security</li>
						<li>Systems Analysis/Design</li>
						<li>Databases</li>
					</ul>

				<p>While I have an interest in just about any topic surrounding IT, these mentioned areas interest myself the most because, the more I learn about these topics the more interested I become. The topics above play an important role in any most every IT setting and I would like to contribute in these areas at a company, government, or other organization.
				</p>

				<p>I continue to gain experience in many areas of IT while working at DeWitt Computer Center. At DCC I am part of a team that supports both small businesses and residential computer users in the Lansing area. I have been included in projects that have dealt with removing computer viruses, setting up small computer networks, configuring various pieces of software, and many more tasks surrounding IT support.
				</p>

				<p>Aside from my academic and professional experiences I have many hobbies. Head over to the hobbies page to find out more.</p>
