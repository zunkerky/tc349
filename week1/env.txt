	My development environment will consist primarly of the text editor Sublime Text and web browsers Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Before making my final decision on a text editor I tried a few of the popular text editors out there for my OS. The editors I tried were Notepad++, Dreamweaver (I know it isn't in the same category of editors), and Gedit (for when I use linux). 
	I started to primarly use Notepad++ because it seemed fairly straight forward and would easily achive what I will need out of an editor. After using Notepad++ I read in a few places online that Sublime text is practically has very similar features to Notepad++ but has a sharper looking GUI.
	I am fairly new to using texteditors for web design, in the past I've mainly used Dreamweaver, but the idead of just a text editor and browser sounds much more appealing to me. I felt as though Dreamweaver is a bit clunky of a program.
	As far as browsers go, I really like Chrome and Firefox about equally as much. I tend not to go near Safari or Internet explorer too much if I can avoid it.
	That's basically all I have to say about my development environment. I look forward to learning more about web development this semester!
