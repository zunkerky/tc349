	After reviewing Jason Santa Maria's website/blog I have mostly postive things to say about it. The first thing I noticed right away was how nice the color scheme looks. The site uses a very simple color scheme and nothing is overwhelming to the eyes. The color scheme is very fitting for a professional website/blog/portfolio that Jason has.
	The next thing I noticed was the ease of navigation on the site. It is very clear to know what page you are on and how to navigate around the site with the icons at the top of the page.
	After navigation, content was the next on my list of positives for his site. Jason has a ton of content on his site but at no time does it feel overwhelming or that you cannot understand what you are reading on the screen. Along with the amount, the subject matter of his content is very appropriate for both a persons personal and professional life. He has a Portfolio and About section that explain who he is and shows of his professional work, while at the same time having a reading and blog section of his site.
	I have a few minor details about the site that I did not like. The first was that I feel that the about section would serve as a better home page than the blog portion. The second was that a few of the icons on the site are a bit to small, like the "..." to expand the articles in his blog section, although I could increase the size of the page on browser to see them better.
	All in all Jason's site is very clean and modern looking. It is easy to see after browsing through his site and portfolio that he is good at what he does for a living.
