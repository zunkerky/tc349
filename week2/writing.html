	<h2>Panic.com Critique</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.panic.com">Panic.com's</a> webpage immediatley stood out to me because of the simple and user friendly UI on their homepage. Panic explains in large text exactly who they are and what they do on their homepage. The color scheme is easy on the eyes, using a fairly light background and dark text. In their opening statement they highlight their name in red making the name Panic stand out and stick in your mind.
		</p>
			
		<p>With large icons that pop up and explain each of the pieces of software the company offers, even a user who was not familiar with Panic or their software would have a basic understanding of who they are and their offerings just by looking at the home page. 
		</p>

		<p>All of Panic's webpages are very nice and clean looking although I do see some issues. The main issue for me is that the software Panic provides is for a more advanced computer user compaired to someone who just surfs the web, checks their email and facebook, etc. With these more complicated and advanced pieces of software the provided documentation is fairly basic (although that can be a positive as well for new users). The other issue I found with the website was that it was somewhat difficult to navigate the Blog portion of the site. On the blog there is no clear method of searching for content and articles related to a specific piece of software they offer.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other than the two minor issues I saw with Panic's site, the site is very visually appealing and easy to navigate. They have easy access on their pages to support via email and they also list useful additional contact info including their address and phone number.
