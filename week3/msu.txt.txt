MSU.edu Critique:

After reviewing the design and content of msu.edu I felt mostly impressed with the website.
At first glance I noticed that the color scheme was easy on the eyes. Using the green and white along with tan and grey made the color contrast very nicely.
The next thing that caught my attention was the banner in the center portion of the page. This banner is designed nicely to display current events surrounding MSU.
The transitions between each banner image are very smooth and scroll in the text in a stylish, not over the top, way.

I feel that whoever designed the MSU website did a wonderful job, considering how much content has to be packed on a university website.
The next piece of criticism is about the design and content of the navigation bar. At the top of the homepage there is a long navigation bar including
information under appropriate title such as "about", "admission", "academics", etc. It is very clear what options are available under each heading in the navigation bar.

I really have no negative criticism for the homepage. Although some people may think there is not enough direct information on the homepage, I feel this is a benefit
because the homepage serves as a sort of hub connecting the visitor to other pages on the site, while giving some basic information. To me the MSU homepage has a great design and
easily connects the sites visitors to their proper destinations.
