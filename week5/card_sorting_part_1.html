		<h1>Card Sorting Part 1: Existing Content</h1>
			<br>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>After reviewing the required materials for week 5 I have learned that card sorting is an essential exercise when creating or updating a website. For part one of the week 5 activities, myself, my girlfriend Stephanie, my sister Natalie, and my mom Gloria performed a card sort for information on the website Foldable.me. All four card sorts were open card sorts performed on a macbook running the software Xsort. Each person was asked to perform an open card sort on the following cards:</p>

			<h2>Analysis</h2>
				<p>The results of all four card sorts are quite interesting. I was the first participant to perform a sort, and was not familiar with all the features of Xsort. As you can see from the results of my card sort, I simply stacked cards on top of one another, unaware that you could create official groups of cards. I feel that my sort most closely resembles the current architecture of Foldable.me, mostly because I was the only one to spend time on the site navigating and recording each of the sites actions and pages.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Steph was the next person to perform a card sort. During her sort we quickly found out that with Xsort you can create groups of cards, instead of just stacking them on top of eachother like I did. With this method it was easy to move groups of cards around the interface and quickly add cards to groups. Steph's sort followed a distinctive pattern of grouping related content together. Both Steph's and my card sort are a little more challenge to analyze because we did not assign a naming convention to the sorted groups. Steph's groups varied the most from the site when reffering to customizing the foldable character. On the site physical attributes, acessories, and clothing were all listed on the same page, whereas with Steph's sort she grouped them into further categories such as hair, head and face attributes, and clothing.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The next card sorter was my sister Natalie. She followed a fairly similar sort to Steph, but went further and was the first to create sub groups, along with group titles. Her sort was the most organized sort, showing that she understood how the content fit and flowed together. As shown in the picture of her sort above, her content was organized into groups containing the main groups called:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Main Items</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Partners</li>
						<li>Site Information</li>
						<li>Social Media</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Gender</li>
					<li>Actions</li>
					<li>Physical Attributes</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Accessories</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Gift Certificates</li>
					<li>Blog Items</li>
				</ul>
				<p>One of the key indicators that showed Natalie understood how the content related were because of the appropriate title names, and because there was a small number of groups, providing evidence that the sites actions relate well with one another.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The final person to perform a sort was my mom Gloria. She implemented the grouping and naming features just like Natalie did. As shown from her results, the grouping convention did not provide names for the groups, only numbers. The cards that Gloria sorted together do follow a pattern of grouping actions and items that are related to one another. However as suggested on <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/card-sorting/">http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/card-sorting/</a> when a card sort ends up having many groups with only one or two items then the percieved relations may be confusing to the card sorter. This seems to be the case with Gloria's sort, she made an organized sort but there are many groups with only one or two items.</p>
