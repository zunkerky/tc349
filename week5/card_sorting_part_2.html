		<h1>Card Sorting Part 2: Original Content</h1>
			<br>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>After performing the card sorts for part one of this weeks exercises, I was puzzled on what I would want to create for part 2. My first thought was to make a more robust personal site that could possibly serve as a professional portfolio in the future. This would be a nice addition to a resume and other online professional profiles like linkedin, especially since I wish to enter the field of IT where many professionals have their own personal sites. My next thought for my final project came when updating my employers facebook page. While updating the facebook page I traveled back and forth to the company website and realized that it needed to be updated, both with new content and design. Although I plan on creating a personal website that will serve as my professional portfolio in the near future, for the final project of this semester I plan on performing an unsolicited redesign for <a href="http:/www.dewittcomputercenter.com">DeWitt Computer Center's</a>website. The website's theme is a bit outdated in both content and desing. The color scheme on the site is not complimentary, and thus makes it diffcult to read the text on some pages. With this redesign, I plan to update just about everything on the site except for the core content that is currently on the site. This redesign will include a new website layout, a responsive design, uniform text size and color schemes throughout the site, and links to social media pages.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The following table lists the cards that were used during the card sort. I used both current content on DeWitt Computer Center's website and new content that I would like to add for this second card sorting activity.</p>

			<h2>Analysis</h2>
				<p>Like the first card sorting activity for this week, I was the first person to perform a sort on the cards made from items from DeWitt Computer Centers website. Once again I was slighty bias in my sorting because I have the most familiarity with the website and because I understand the information on the cards a bit more because I encounter those terms on a daily basis at work. When analyzing my card sort I discovered I kept some items in the same location as on the website, while others I changed. One item I changed was that I felt there should be more contact information on the homepage rather than just the phone number. The contact information could be placed in a footer below the main content of the page, as seen on most every standard website. One thing I kept the same with my card sort was Services page. I felt that the current main items in the services page was appropriate and that was reflected in my card sort. </p>
				<br>
				<p>The next person to perform a sort was Steph. Out of the people who performed card sorts for part 2, Steph is the second most familiar with the current layout of DeWitt Computer Center's website. As shown in the picture of her results above, her sort varied slightly from the current layout of the site. Some cards were more straightforward than others, such as the FAQ section, it was clear what cards belonged with the FAQ card. Steph's other sorts were grouped into seemingly appropriate collections of cards. Although her sort did not match the current structure of the site exactly, all of her sorts seem like logical placement.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Natalie was the third person to perform a card sort for part 2 of this weeks activity. I feel that her sort differed greatly from the current layout of the site. After viewing the final results of her sort it appears that many of the terms used were confusing to her, and as a result there ended up being many single card groups. In order to help aliviate this confusion for future visitors to the site changing the names of links and categories may be appropriate, or at least documentation on the site to explain the definition of each service/product that may be confusing to visitors.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The final person to do a card sort was Gloria. She had very similar results to Natalie's. It seemed as though unless you were familiar with computer repair topics or the current layout of DeWitt Computer Center's website the cards were confusing to sort. Gloria had about just as many single card groups as Natalie, showing that some re-defining of terms on the site may be appropriate.</p>
